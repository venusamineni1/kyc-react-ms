# but for now, we can still point them directly OR if we used @LoadBalanced we would use service names.
# For Phase 3, let's keep them as direct URLs for the moment, OR switch to gateway.
# Actually, if Viewer is now on 8083, it should CALL the other services.
# The Gateway is just an entry point for EXTERNAL traffic. Internal traffic can still be direct or via Gateway.
